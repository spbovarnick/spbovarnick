# Howdy! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software developer born tinkerer. I have a compulsion for learning how systems work, how I can disassemble them, and put them back together has led me to develop a diverse set of skills ranging from trail-building to building full-stack web apps using Django, Node.js, and React. Before my career in development, my passion for learning led me through a Master of Education and classroom teaching. Being able to effectively distill and communicate complex ideas and concepts and facilitate learning are integral components of my own learning and development. As a developer, I am driven by the same thirst for knowledge. No matter the size or scope of a project, I methodically identify core problems and implement efficient, DRY solutions.

# Projects

## [DriftCast](https://drift-cast.herokuapp.com/)

### MERN App

DriftCast is a mobile-ready application for angler's. So far, DriftCast features several popular rivers around Northwest Oregon.

Using real-time stream gage data from the U.S. Geological Survey API, atmospheric data from the National Weather Service API and knowledge developed from years of experience on the water, DriftCast allows Portland-area anglers to quickly check the conditions on popular streams.

Users get a quick-view index of all featured rivers. Each quick-view "card" communicates whether conditions are favorable for fishing based on current river gage height. Cards are clickable and take users to a detail page where users can see more specific stream and atmospheric data about that river as well as user trip reports.

Using JWT, users can create an account and login to CRUD their own trip reports or river detail pages.

## [AnomaliesAnonymous](https://www.anomaliesanonymous.com/)

### Django Project

Designed and developed a responsive full-stack Django app hosted on Heroku with full CRUD capabilities, using Python, PostgreSQL, HTML JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, geocoder, crispy forms, Git/GitHub, Figma, and VS Code.

This app builds upon a NUFORC database of nearly 65,000 UFO sightings from around the United States dating from 1910-2014. Users are able to browse, search, and filter the sightings. By making an account, users can add their own sightings to the database and leave comments on sighting reports. A heat map offers a handy geo-spatial representation of sightings.

## [FlyBin](https://fly-bin.herokuapp.com/)

### MEN App

Built with Mongoose, ExpressJS and NodeJS, FlyBin was designed out my own frustration with keeping track of my fishing flies. I tie my own flies and when I sit down at the vise, it's easy to mistakenly double up on patterns or fail to replenish depleted patterns.

FlyBin allows the user to digitally catalog their collection of flies and create notes for different patterns. For many anglers these practices are already hardcopy habit, but FlyBin allows full CRUD access to that data anywhere with a cell signal.
